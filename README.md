### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Shailaja

I am a Data Scientist with skills in Machine Learning & Deep Learning. I have worked on frameworks such as Tensorflow, PyTorch, Langchain, & statistical packages including Scikit-learn, Scipy, Statsmodels etc., I also developed apps using Flask, Streamlit, Heroku, Docker etc. I built several end-to-end solutions for usecases including, predictive maintence, automated damage detection, object detection and localisation, semantic search, image classification, timeseries forecasting at scale among others.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working in AI/ML
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning GenAI concepts and working hands-on on usecases
- ðŸ”¥ I'm passionate about building Computer Vision models using CNN archietctures to solve engineering problems like damage detection, object deetction etc.,
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Deep Learning Projects
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about How to get started in Data Science
